    faq: {
      title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
      removable: {
        question: "Can watermarks be removed from a PDF?",
        answer: "Our standard watermarks are semi-permanent and difficult to remove without specialized software. However, they are not completely tamper-proof. For more secure, tamper-resistant watermarking, consider our Pro plan which offers advanced security features that embed watermarks more deeply into the document structure."
      },
      printing: {
        question: "Will watermarks appear when the document is printed?",
        answer: "Yes, watermarks will appear when the document is printed. You can control the opacity to make them more subtle for printed documents while still being visible. The text watermarks will always print, while image watermarks will print based on your opacity settings."
      },
      pages: {
        question: "Can I watermark specific pages only?",
        answer: "Yes, our Pro plan allows you to apply watermarks to specific pages rather than the entire document. You can select individual pages, ranges, or even apply different watermarks to different sections of your document."
      },
      formats: {
        question: "What image formats are supported for image watermarks?",
        answer: "We support PNG, JPG/JPEG, and SVG formats for image watermarks. PNG is recommended for logos and images that require transparency. For best results, use high-resolution images with transparent backgrounds."
      },
      multiple: {
        question: "Can I add multiple watermarks to a single document?",
        answer: "Pro users can add multiple watermarks to a single document, such as combining a logo in the corner with a 'Confidential' text watermark diagonally across the page. Free users are limited to one watermark per document."
      },
      q1: {
        question: "Is my PDF file secure?",
        answer: "Yes, all uploads are processed securely on our servers and automatically deleted after processing. We don't store or share your files."
      },
      q2: {
        question: "What types of watermarks can I add?",
        answer: "You can add text watermarks with customizable fonts, colors, and opacity, or image watermarks using PNG, JPG, or SVG files."
      },
      q3: {
        question: "Can I remove a watermark after adding it?",
        answer: "Once a watermark is added and the file is downloaded, it becomes a permanent part of the PDF. There's no automatic way to remove it."
      },
      q4: {
        question: "Is there a file size limit?",
        answer: "Yes, the maximum file size for PDF uploads is 50MB. For image watermarks, the maximum size is 5MB."

      answer1: "ScanPro supports converting PDFs to many formats including Word (DOCX), Excel (XLSX), PowerPoint (PPTX), images (JPG, PNG), HTML, and plain text. You can also convert these formats back to PDF.",
      question2: "How accurate are your PDF conversions?",
      answer2: "Our conversion engine uses advanced algorithms to maintain formatting, including fonts, images, tables, and layout. However, very complex documents may have minor formatting differences. For best results, we recommend using our 'PDF to Word' or 'PDF to Excel' tools for documents with complex formatting.",
      question3: "Is there a file size limit for conversions?",
      answer3: "Free users can convert files up to 10MB. Basic subscribers can convert files up to 50MB, Pro subscribers up to 100MB, and Enterprise users up to 500MB. If you need to process larger files, please contact us for custom solutions.",
      question4: "Why did my PDF conversion fail?",
      answer4: "Conversions may fail if the file is corrupted, password-protected, or contains complex elements our system can't process. Try using our 'Repair PDF' tool first, then retry the conversion. If you're still having issues, try our 'Advanced' conversion mode or contact support."
    },
    security: {
      question1: "How do I password protect my PDF?",
      answer1: "Use our 'Protect PDF' tool. Upload your PDF, set a password, choose permission restrictions (if desired), and click 'Protect PDF'. You can control whether users can print, edit, or copy content from your PDF.",
      question2: "Can I remove a password from my PDF?",
      answer2: "Yes, use our 'Unlock PDF' tool. You'll need to provide the current password to remove protection. Note that we only help remove password protection from documents you own or have authorization to modify.",
      question3: "What encryption level do you use for PDF protection?",
      answer3: "We use industry-standard 256-bit AES encryption for PDF protection, which offers strong security for your documents. We also support 128-bit encryption if you need compatibility with older PDF readers."

      legality: {
        question: "Are digital signatures legally binding?",
        answer: "Digital signatures created with our tool are visually similar to handwritten signatures. For legally binding electronic signatures that comply with regulations like eIDAS or ESIGN Act, you may need a qualified electronic signature service. Our tool is suitable for internal documents, drafts, or when visual signatures are sufficient."
      },
      security: {
        question: "How secure are the signatures?",
        answer: "Our signatures are visual overlays on the PDF document. They provide a visual representation of consent but do not include cryptographic security features found in advanced digital signature solutions. Your documents are processed securely, and we don't store your signed PDFs."
      },
      formats: {
        question: "What signature formats are supported?",
        answer: "You can create signatures by drawing with your mouse/touchpad, uploading an image file (PNG, JPG with transparent background recommended), or typing your name in various font styles."

      multipleSignatures: {
        question: "Can I add multiple signatures to a document?",
